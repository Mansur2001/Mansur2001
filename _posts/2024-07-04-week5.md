title: Week 5
---

This week, I focused on ensuring that the final ballot output met the strict requirement of exactly 10 lines, regardless of inconsistencies or missing data in the scanned ballots. This involved making adjustments to the iOCR algorithm to ensure that any combined or incomplete lines were correctly split and reformatted, maintaining the integrity of the output. After each adjustment, I conducted thorough testing by scanning ballots with the Brother OCR machine, processing the data with iOCR, and then reviewing the results. The spreadsheet continued to be an essential tool for tracking the success rates of these tests, particularly in identifying persistent issues with incomplete or improperly formatted data. The week focused on incremental improvements of edge cases found through testing OCR scans. By the end of the week, the algorithm was more reliable in producing a final ballot with exactly 10 lines, though continued testing and refinement were necessary to fully resolve the remaining issues.
