title: Week 3
---
The project took a significant turn this week as I transitioned from the original machine learning plant sensor project to a new focus on social computing for good, due to logistical delays in the original project. This new direction led me to join a research group that was addressing a ballot detection and correction problem, an area with direct implications for the integrity of democratic processes. My initial tasks involved familiarizing myself with the research goals and methodologies, which included understanding the existing tools and algorithms being used. The week was largely spent reviewing relevant literature and case studies within the domain of social computing, alongside setting up the necessary development environment. I also began preliminary work on understanding how Optical Character Recognition (OCR) could be leveraged in this context and preparing for the more technical challenges that lay ahead.
