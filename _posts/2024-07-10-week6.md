title: Week 6
---

In the sixth week, I focused on addressing specific edge cases that had been identified as problematic outputs in previous weeks. These included random lines that were longer than the longest line in the ballot, as well as lines with unusual spacing between characters. These issues had previously caused the iOCR algorithm to misinterpret or incorrectly process certain lines, leading to errors in the final output. To tackle these edge cases, I updated the iOCR algorithm to include new logic that could detect and correct these anomalies. After each update, I rigorously tested the algorithm by scanning ballots with the Brother OCR machine, processing the data with iOCR, and then carefully analyzing the results. The updated algorithm showed significant improvements by effectively handling these edge cases and bringing us closer to achieving a 100 percent success rate. By the end of the week, these edge cases were consistently resolved and the success rate of the algorithm improved as documented in the spreadsheet.
