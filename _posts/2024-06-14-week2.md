In the second week of my internship the focus began to shift from developing the theoretical understanding into practical development. I was responsible for developing a Javascript pipeline that parses and calculates ballot data and computing the distance between character changes of the static ballot compared to a scanned ballot.televoting system emphasizes security and accessibility. Collaboration with cybersecurity experts allowed us to integrate robust security measures, ensuring the system is resilient against fraud and tampering. Concurrently, we worked on creating a user friendly interface by incorporating feedback from preliminary user testing sessions to enhance usability for all individuals, including those with disabilities. This week marked significant progress as we moved from conceptual discussions to tangible development, setting the stage for further refinement and testing in the coming weeks.
