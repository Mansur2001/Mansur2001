## About My Project

The NSF research project focuses on understanding plant roots and their adaptation to changing climates by using advanced sensor technologies like minirhizotron (MR) systems. These systems capture color images of roots through cameras placed in the soil, but preparing these images for scientific research is labor-intensive and requires human interpretation. The project aims to develop machine learning tools to automate this process and improve the collaboration between humans and machine learning algorithms. By involving plant scientists of varying expertise, including novices and youth, the project seeks to enhance the interactive machine learning experience and encourage more students to see themselves as future scientists. This effort includes participatory co-design workshops and summer science experiences with Florida 4-H programs. The outcomes will advance both the data analysis of MR systems in plant science and the broader application of human-centered machine learning in other fields like human anatomy and hydrology. Ultimately, the project aims to increase productivity, sustainability, and resilience in agricultural and natural ecosystems while also expanding the STEM workforce by involving marginalized youth.
