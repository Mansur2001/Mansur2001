In the final week of completing the javascript pipeline the focus was on achieving a 100 percent success rate by thoroughly testing the iOCR algorithm. With the major edge cases now addressed, specifically those involving random line lengths and unusual spacing.I conducted a series of tests using the Brother OCR machine and the iOCR algorithm. These tests confirmed that the algorithm was now capable of correctly processing and formatting ballot data under all tested conditions. The success rate reached 100 percent, indicating that the algorithm was fully reliable in its current state. This was successful conclusion to my contribution to the project. I finalized the documented spreadsheets that included detailed descriptions of the edge cases and how they were resolved, and prepared the project for handover to the research group.
