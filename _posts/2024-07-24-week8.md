title: Week 8
---

This week I spent my time at the Florida Museum's shark tooth AI workshop, this week involved the integration of Language learning models in K-8 classes. At the start of the week, we went through several presentations that discussed the need for AI in education through examples such as NSF funding of educational AI. On the third day, we went through a machine learning workshop; we are presented with a web app that allows users to create neural networks with no code. We used a variety of shark species as an example for completing a neural network. This idea was meant to prove that integration of AI and computer science within education will only help students become more educated.
